# HGR-Signal
The program uses OpenCV and MediaPipe Hands solution to recognize whether a person's hand is open or closed and display "Stop" or "Go" accordingly. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

Initialization: The program initializes the MediaPipe Hands solution and sets up the webcam using OpenCV.

Frame Processing: The program reads frames from the webcam and converts them to RGB color space.

Hand Landmark Detection: The MediaPipe Hands solution processes the frame and detects the hand landmarks (e.g., finger tips, wrist, etc.).

Hand Openness Calculation: The program calculates the hand openness by analyzing the finger spread and thumb position. This is done by averaging the visibility and z-coordinate of each landmark, weighted by their type (e.g., finger tips are more important than wrist).

Threshold Comparison: The program compares the calculated hand openness with the threshold values. If the hand openness is above hand_open_threshold, it considers the hand to be open; otherwise, it considers it closed.

Output: Based on whether the hand is open or closed, the program displays "Stop" or "Go" on the screen using OpenCV's putText function.

Loop: The program continues to process frames from the webcam and update the output until you press the 'q' key to exit.

The program uses a simple threshold-based approach to recognize hand openness, which may not work well in all environments. You may need to adjust the threshold values or fine-tune the algorithm to improve its accuracy.
